# MAFS5220
These group projects were developed by a group of students who studied a master course in Financial Mathematics "Quantitative and Statistical Risk Analysis", which is about how to compute the price of a deal by considering the counterparty credit risk.
These projects made use of QuantLib and Boost libraries, so that some fundamental building blocks could be re-used and the students could focus on developing somethings new and innovative.
Group 1 project: Create an Android mobile app that computes CVA (as a cloud service).
Group 2 project: Compute the FVA, CVA and DVA of interest rate swap with a non-collateral counterparty.
Group 4 project: Compute the bilateral CVA of an equity forward.
Group 5 project: Compute the unilateral CVA of a FX forward.
